4. **Configuration-Driven**: Everything configurable via YAML/environment
5. **Prometheus Metrics**: Industry-standard monitoring
6. **Docker Deployment**: Consistent environment and easy scaling

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Go-Python Integration
**Solution**: Implemented gRPC service with protobuf definitions, allowing seamless communication between Go services and Python ML components.
