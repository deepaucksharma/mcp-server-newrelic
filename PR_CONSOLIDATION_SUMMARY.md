# Pull Request Consolidation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the consolidation of PRs #2 and #3 into a single, comprehensive enhancement that integrates cleanly with our improved codebase.

## Original PRs

### PR #2: Improve cleanup and plugin unloading
- **Purpose**: Better resource management and cleanup
- **Key Features**:
  - Connection pool reference counting
  - Proper plugin unloading
  - Service unregistration

### PR #3: Add documentation search capability
- **Purpose**: Local documentation search for New Relic docs
- **Key Features**:
  - Clone and cache docs repository
  - Search documentation by keyword
  - Retrieve doc content

## Consolidation Approach

Rather than merging the PRs with conflicts, we:

1. **Cherry-picked the best features** from each PR
2. **Resolved conflicts** by keeping our enhanced implementations
3. **Added comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
4. **Maintained backwards compatibility**
5. **Improved upon the original implementations**

## What Was Merged

### 1. Documentation Search (from PR #3)
✅ **core/docs_cache.py** - Complete implementation with improvements:
- Security checks for path traversal
- Configurable cache location
- Better error handling
- Support for multiple doc locations
- URL generation for docs.newrelic.com

✅ **features/docs.py** - Enhanced plugin with:
- Multiple search tools
- Cache management tools
- Topic listing resource
- Proper service registration

### 2. Resource Cleanup (from PR #2)
✅ **Connection Pool Reference Counting**:
- Track references to shared connection pools
- Clean up pools when last reference is released
- Thread-safe implementation

✅ **Plugin Unloading**:
- Remove tools from FastMCP registry
- Remove resources from FastMCP registry
- Unregister provided services
- Clear plugin state properly

✅ **Service Registry Enhancement**:
- Added unregister() method
- Proper cleanup of service providers

### 3. Additional Improvements

✅ **Comprehensive Tests**:
- test_docs_plugin.py - Full coverage of docs functionality
- test_plugin_unloading.py - Verify cleanup works correctly
- test_connection_pool_refcount.py - Test pool management

✅ **Documentation Updates**:
- Updated README with docs feature
- Enhanced .env.example with docs configuration
- Updated CHANGELOG with all changes

✅ **Backwards Compatibility**:
- Added cache_result alias for legacy code
- Maintained existing APIs

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Cleaner Integration**: Features work seamlessly with our enhanced architecture
2. **Better Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
3. **Improved Security**: Added path traversal prevention and input validation
4. **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized caching and connection pooling
5. **Maintainability**: Consistent code style and patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Close Original PRs**: Reference this consolidated implementation
2. **Create New PR**: Submit the consolidated changes from the feature branch
3. **Testing**: Run full test suite to ensure everything works
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all new features are documented
