# Technical Vision Document
## Universal Data Synthesizer (UDS) for New Relic
### AI-Powered Dashboard Generation with MCP/A2A Standards

### Version 2.0 | December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

The Universal Data Synthesizer (UDS) represents a revolutionary approach to observability, transforming how organizations interact with their data in New Relic. By leveraging MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) standards, we're building an intelligent system that can autonomously generate dashboards, analyze patterns, and provide insights through natural conversation with GitHub Copilot.

This vision document outlines our strategy to create an enterprise-grade platform that can handle everything from simple queries to complex, hours-long analytical workflows while maintaining the security, reliability, and performance that production environments demand.

## 3. Core Architecture

### 3.1 MCP Tool Server Implementation

The MCP server exposes UDS capabilities as discoverable tools that any AI assistant can use:

```python
class UDSMCPServer(Server):
    """Enterprise-grade MCP server with streaming capabilities"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="uds-tools",
            version="2.0.0",
            description="Universal Data Synthesizer for New Relic"
        )
        
        # Core engines
        self.discovery_engine = DiscoveryEngine()
        self.pattern_engine = PatternEngine()
        self.query_generator = QueryGenerator()
        self.dashboard_builder = DashboardBuilder()
        
    @tool(
        name="discover_all_data",
        description="Discover all available data with zero assumptions",
        parameters={
            "depth": {"type": "string", "enum": ["quick", "standard", "comprehensive"]},
            "focus_area": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional area to focus on"}
        }
    )
    async def discover_all_data(self, depth="standard", focus_area=None):
        """Comprehensive data discovery with progress streaming"""
        # Implementation details in architecture doc
```

### 3.2 Agent-Based Architecture

Each agent is a specialized expert that handles specific aspects of the dashboard creation workflow:

```python
class OrchestratorAgent(Agent):
    """Main coordinator for multi-hour workflows"""
    
    async def create_dashboard_workflow(self, request: DashboardRequest):
        # 1. Discovery Phase (Explorer Agent)
        discovery = await self.delegate_to_explorer(request.context)
        
        # 2. Analysis Phase (Analyst Agent)
        patterns = await self.delegate_to_analyst(discovery)
        
        # 3. Mapping Phase (Cartographer Agent)
        relationships = await self.delegate_to_cartographer(discovery, patterns)
        
        # 4. Visualization Phase (Visualizer Agent)
        dashboard = await self.delegate_to_visualizer(
            discovery, patterns, relationships, request.requirements
        )
        
        return dashboard
```

### 3.3 Production Deployment Architecture

## 4. Innovation Areas

### 4.1 Zero-Knowledge Discovery

The system can discover and understand your entire NRDB data landscape without any prior configuration:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Discovery Process"
        A[Start] --> B[Scan All Schemas]
        B --> C[Intelligent Sampling]
        C --> D[Pattern Detection]
        D --> E[Quality Assessment]
        E --> F[Relationship Mapping]
        F --> G[Insight Generation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Outputs"
        G --> H[Complete Data Map]
        G --> I[Quality Scores]
        G --> J[Discovered Patterns]
        G --> K[Recommendations]
    end
```

### 4.2 Conversational Dashboard Creation

Natural language interaction for complex dashboard requirements:

```yaml
User: "Create a dashboard showing our API performance with focus on checkout service"

System Actions:
  1. Discover all API-related data
  2. Identify checkout service metrics
  3. Detect performance patterns
  4. Find correlated infrastructure metrics
  5. Generate optimized dashboard layout
  6. Create alerts based on patterns
  
Result: Complete dashboard in < 5 minutes
```

### 4.3 Autonomous Pattern Analysis

The system continuously learns and identifies patterns without human intervention:

```python
class PatternEngine:
    def detect_patterns(self, data_stream):
        patterns = []
        
        # Temporal patterns (seasonality, trends)
        patterns.extend(self.detect_temporal_patterns(data_stream))
        
        # Correlation patterns (related metrics)
        patterns.extend(self.detect_correlations(data_stream))
        
        # Anomaly patterns (outliers, changes)
        patterns.extend(self.detect_anomalies(data_stream))
        
        # Business patterns (usage, cost)
        patterns.extend(self.detect_business_patterns(data_stream))
        
        return self.rank_by_significance(patterns)
```

### 4.4 Self-Optimizing Queries

Queries that automatically optimize themselves based on performance and cost:

```yaml
Original Query: "SELECT * FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'checkout'"

Optimized Query:
  - Added time range based on data density
  - Selected only relevant fields
  - Added sampling for high-volume periods
  - Included TIMESERIES for visualization
  - Added comparison with baseline

Result: 95% faster, 80% less data scanned
```
