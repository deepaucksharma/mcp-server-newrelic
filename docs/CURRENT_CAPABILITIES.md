# Current Capabilities - What Actually Works

This document provides an honest assessment of what functionality is currently available in the New Relic MCP Server implementation.

## ‚úÖ What Works Today

### Basic Infrastructure
- **JSON-RPC Interface**: Basic request/response over STDIO, HTTP, SSE
- **Session Management**: Simple session storage (underutilized)
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config loading
- **Mock Mode**: Can run without New Relic connection

### Discovery Tools (Limited)
- **`discovery.explore_event_types`**
  - Lists available event types
  - Basic implementation without rich metadata
  - No filtering or advanced options

### Query Tools (Basic)
- **`nrql.execute`**
  - Executes raw NRQL queries
  - No schema validation
  - No adaptive rewriting
  - No query optimization
  - Simple pass-through to New Relic API

### Infrastructure Features
- **EU Region Support**: Configured but not exposed through tools
- **APM Integration**: Infrastructure exists but not utilized
- **Caching**: Basic implementation exists but underused
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented at infrastructure level

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work (Despite Documentation)

### Missing Tool Categories
1. **Analysis Tools** (0% implemented)
   - No anomaly detection
   - No correlation analysis
   - No trend detection
   - No forecasting
   - No root cause analysis

2. **Action Tools** (0% implemented)
   - Cannot create alerts
   - Cannot generate dashboards
   - Cannot modify configurations
   - Cannot manage SLOs

3. **Governance Tools** (0% implemented)
   - No cost analysis
   - No usage auditing
   - No compliance checking
   - No resource optimization

4. **Advanced Discovery** (~10% implemented)
   - Cannot discover attributes
   - Cannot profile data quality
   - Cannot find relationships
   - Cannot detect patterns

5. **Workflow Tools** (0% implemented)
   - No multi-step operations
   - No orchestration
   - No conditional logic
   - No parallel execution

### Missing Core Features
- **Schema-Aware Queries**: Queries fail if schema doesn't match
- **Adaptive Behavior**: No automatic fallbacks or retries
- **Intelligence Layer**: No interpretation or recommendations
- **Cross-Account Support**: Hardcoded to single account
- **Context Propagation**: Tools don't share discoveries

## üîß Practical Usage Today

### What You CAN Do:
```json
// 1. See what event types exist
{"method": "discovery.explore_event_types"}

// 2. Run a simple NRQL query
{"method": "nrql.execute", "params": {"query": "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction"}}
```

### What You CANNOT Do:
```json
// ‚ùå Discover attributes of an event type
{"method": "discovery.explore_attributes", "params": {"event_type": "Transaction"}}

// ‚ùå Build a query from intent
{"method": "nrql.build_from_intent", "params": {"intent": "error_rate"}}

// ‚ùå Detect anomalies
{"method": "analysis.find_anomalies", "params": {"metric": "duration"}}

// ‚ùå Create an alert
{"method": "alert.create_from_baseline", "params": {...}}

// ‚ùå Run a workflow
{"method": "workflow.performance_investigation", "params": {"entity": "..."}}
```

## üìä Implementation Statistics

| Category | Documented | Implemented | Percentage |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Discovery Tools | ~30 | 1 | 3% |
| Query Tools | ~20 | 1 | 5% |
| Analysis Tools | ~25 | 0 | 0% |
| Action Tools | ~20 | 0 | 0% |
| Governance Tools | ~15 | 0 | 0% |
| Workflow Tools | ~10 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **120+** | **~2** | **<2%** |

## üéØ Recommended Use Cases

Given current limitations, the server is suitable for:

1. **Basic Data Exploration**
   - Listing what event types are available
   - Running simple NRQL queries

2. **Proof of Concept**
   - Demonstrating MCP integration
   - Testing JSON-RPC communication

The server is NOT ready for:
- Production observability workflows
- AI-assisted incident response
- Automated monitoring setup
- Cost optimization analysis
- Any complex multi-step operations

## üö¶ Getting Started Realistically

1. **Lower Expectations**: Understand only basic queries work
2. **Use Mock Mode**: Test without New Relic connection
3. **Manual Orchestration**: Prepare to handle all workflow logic client-side
4. **Check Implementation**: Verify tools exist before using

Example realistic session:
```bash
# Start server
make run-mock

# List event types (works)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"discovery.explore_event_types","id":1}' | ./bin/mcp-server

# Run simple query (works)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"nrql.execute","params":{"query":"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction"},"id":2}' | ./bin/mcp-server

# Try advanced features (will fail)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"analysis.find_anomalies","params":{"metric":"duration"},"id":3}' | ./bin/mcp-server
```

## üìÖ When Will Features Be Ready?

See [Implementation Gaps Analysis](./IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed timeline recommendations:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core discovery and query tools
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Analysis and intelligence features
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Action and governance tools
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Production readiness

## Conclusion

The New Relic MCP Server currently provides <2% of its documented functionality. It can list event types and execute basic NRQL queries, but lacks all advanced features including discovery-first workflows, analysis capabilities, and action tools. 

For production use, significant development is required to close the gap between documentation and implementation.
