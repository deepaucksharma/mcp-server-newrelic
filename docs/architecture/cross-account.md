# Cross-Account Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of cross-account dashboard support in the New Relic MCP Server, based on the NerdGraph dashboard management best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Tool Registration (`pkg/interface/mcp/tools_dashboard.go`)
- Added `account_ids` parameter to the `generate_dashboard` tool:
  ```go
  "account_ids": {
      Type:        "array",
      Description: "List of account IDs for cross-account dashboards",
      Items: &Property{
          Type: "integer",
      },
  }
  ```

### 2. Dashboard Generation Functions
Updated all dashboard generation functions to accept and use account IDs:

#### a. Golden Signals Dashboard
- Function signature: `generateGoldenSignalsDashboard(name, serviceName string, accountIDs []int)`
- Adds `WITH accountIds = [...]` clause to all NRQL queries when account IDs are provided
- Example query: `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'service' TIMESERIES WITH accountIds = [12345, 67890]`

#### b. SLI/SLO Dashboard
- Function signature: `generateSLISLODashboard(name string, sliConfig map[string]interface{}, accountIDs []int)`
- Applies account IDs to all SLI-related queries
- Properly handles error budget calculations across accounts

#### c. Infrastructure Dashboard
- Function signature: `generateInfrastructureDashboard(name, hostPattern string, accountIDs []int)`
- Enables infrastructure monitoring across multiple accounts
- Supports SystemSample and NetworkSample queries

#### d. Discovery-Based Dashboard
- Updated `generateDiscoveryBasedDashboard` to accept account IDs
- Modified all widget creation functions:
  - `createOverviewWidget`
  - `createNumericWidget`
  - `createFacetedWidget`
  - `createArrayWidget` (new addition)

### 3. Input Validation Improvements
- Fixed type assertions to prevent panics
- Added proper validation for required fields in SLI config
- Safe extraction of optional parameters

### 4. Dashboard Metadata
- All generated dashboards now include `account_ids` in their metadata when cross-account IDs are specified
- This helps track which accounts the dashboard queries

## Usage Examples

### Single Account Dashboard
```json
{
  "template": "golden-signals",
  "service_name": "my-service",
  "account_ids": [12345]
}
```

### Multi-Account Dashboard
```json
{
  "template": "infrastructure",
  "host_pattern": "prod-*",
  "account_ids": [11111, 22222, 33333]
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
Dashboards can still be created without specifying account IDs:
```json
{
  "template": "golden-signals",
  "service_name": "my-service"
}
```

## NRQL Query Format
When account IDs are provided, queries are modified as follows:

**Without account IDs:**
```sql
SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample TIMESERIES
```

**With account IDs:**
```sql
SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample TIMESERIES WITH accountIds = [12345, 67890]
```

## Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tools_dashboard_test.go`
- Tests cover:
  - Single account scenarios
  - Multiple account scenarios
  - Backward compatibility (no account IDs)
  - Dashboard validation
  - Query generation verification

## Benefits
1. **Cross-Account Visibility**: Monitor resources across multiple New Relic accounts from a single dashboard
2. **Consolidated Views**: Create unified dashboards for organizations with multiple accounts
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Support for 1 to N accounts per dashboard
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing dashboard generation continues to work without changes

## Future Enhancements
1. Add support for account ID validation against actual New Relic accounts
2. Implement account-specific widget creation (different queries per account)
3. Add cross-account alert creation support
4. Support for dynamic account ID resolution based on tags or metadata

## Notes
- The implementation follows NerdGraph best practices for cross-account queries
- Account IDs in NRQL queries must be specified as a comma-separated list in square brackets
- The primary account ID (from dashboard creation) must have visibility into the specified accounts
- Cross-account queries may have performance implications for very large datasets
