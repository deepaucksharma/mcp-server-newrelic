# Python Clarification Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the clarifications made to the documentation regarding Python code in the MCP Server repository.

## Key Clarifications Made

### 1. Architecture Documentation Updates

**File: `docs/architecture/complete-reference.md`**
- Removed references to "Dual Implementation Architecture" and "Python to Go Migration"
- Clarified that the MCP server is a Go implementation only
- Explained that Python code exists for:
  - Client SDKs (`clients/python/`) - Python client library for the MCP server
  - Intelligence microservice (`intelligence/`) - Optional Python service for ML features
- Updated architecture diagrams to show Go as the core server with client SDKs and optional services

### 2. Technical Specification Updates

**File: `docs/technical/platform-spec.md`**
- Updated roadmap section from "New-Branch → GA" to "Development → GA"
- Clarified that intelligence service is an optional Python microservice, not a dual implementation
- Updated quick-start instructions to use main branch instead of "new-branch"
- Added language clarification in North-Star Goals

### 3. Code Example Updates

**File: `docs/architecture/data-observability.md`**
- Converted Python code examples to Go
- Updated tool metadata examples from Python decorators to Go tool registration
- Maintained functionality while using appropriate language for the Go server

### 4. Roadmap Updates

**File: `ROADMAP_2025.md`**
- Changed "Remove Python implementation" to "Remove deprecated code and improve architecture"
- Reflects that there's no Python MCP server to remove

## Architecture Clarification

The actual architecture is:

```
mcp-server-newrelic/
├── Go MCP Server (Core)
│   ├── cmd/              # Entry points

```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **MCP Server**: Written in Go for performance and type safety
2. **Client SDKs**: Available in Python and TypeScript for different language ecosystems
3. **Intelligence Service**: Optional Python microservice for advanced ML features
4. **No Dual Implementation**: There is no Python MCP server implementation
5. **No Migration Needed**: The Go implementation is the only MCP server

## Documentation Consistency

All references to Python implementation, dual implementation, or migration between Python and Go have been updated or removed. The documentation now consistently reflects that:

- The MCP server is a Go implementation
- Python code exists only for client SDKs and optional ML services
- There is no deprecated Python server to migrate from

This ensures clarity for contributors and users about the project's architecture and implementation language.
