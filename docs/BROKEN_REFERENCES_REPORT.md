## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Guides**:
   - `docs/guides/quickstart.md` - A dedicated quick start guide
   - `docs/guides/contributing.md` - Contributing guidelines
   - `docs/examples/workflow-patterns.md` - Workflow patterns guide

2. **Update All References**:
   - Replace `API_REFERENCE_V2.md` with `api/reference.md` âœ“ COMPLETED
   - Update all documentation paths to reflect new structure
   - Remove or update Python implementation references

3. **Consolidate Philosophy Documents**:
   - Create `docs/philosophy/discovery-philosophy.md` if needed
   - Or update references to point to existing discovery-first documentation

4. **Fix Documentation Structure File**:
   - `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` needs major updates
   - Many referenced files don't exist or have moved

5. **Update Ecosystem Overview**:
   - `docs/architecture/ecosystem-overview.md` has many broken links
   - Needs comprehensive update to reflect current structure

## Files Needing Immediate Attention

1. `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` - Most broken references
2. `docs/architecture/ecosystem-overview.md` - Second most broken references
3. `docs/guides/refactoring.md` - API reference needs updating
4. `docs/guides/migration.md` - API reference needs updating
5. `README.md` - Development guide references
6. `CLAUDE.md` - Development guide reference
