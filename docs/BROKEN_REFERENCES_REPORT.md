   - Fixed undefined types and methods in `tools_analysis.go`
   - Fixed type mismatches in `tools_discovery_granular.go`
   - Implemented missing handler methods for workflow tools
   - Fixed all undefined types (EnhancedTool, ToolCategory, SafetyMetadata, etc.)

2. **Test Infrastructure** - E2E testing framework has been implemented:
   - Created comprehensive E2E test harness in `tests/e2e/`
   - Added YAML-based scenario definitions
   - Implemented discovery-first testing approach

3. **Tool Implementations** - Missing handlers have been added:
   - Workflow management handlers
   - Discovery tool implementations
   - Analysis tool stubs

### ðŸ”§ Remaining Documentation Tasks

#### 1. QUICKSTART.md References
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` (line 49)
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/ecosystem-overview.md` (line 291)
- **Issue**: References `QUICKSTART.md` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Should reference quick start section in main README.md or create a new quickstart guide in docs/guides/

#### 2. TROUBLESHOOTING.md References
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` (line 30)
- **Issue**: Still references old path
- **Fix**: Update to `guides/troubleshooting.md`

#### 3. CONTRIBUTING.md References
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` (line 80)
- **Location**: `cmd/uds/README.md` (line 293)
- **Issue**: References `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `guides/contributing.md`
- **Fix**: Should reference development guide or create a contributing guide

#### 4. Other Outdated Documentation References
In `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md`:

In `docs/architecture/ecosystem-overview.md`:
- Line 21: `philosophy/DISCOVERY_PHILOSOPHY.md` - doesn't exist
- Line 30: `TECHNICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md` - should be `technical/platform-spec.md`

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on User-Facing Documentation**:
   - Create `docs/guides/quickstart.md` - A dedicated quick start guide
   - Update README.md with clearer getting started instructions

2. **Clean Up Architecture Docs**:
   - Update `docs/architecture/documentation-structure.md` with correct paths
   - Update `docs/architecture/ecosystem-overview.md` with current structure

3. **Remove or Consolidate**:
   - Many referenced files don't exist and may not be needed
   - Consider consolidating into fewer, more comprehensive guides

## Priority

Since the code now compiles and runs successfully, documentation cleanup is lower priority but should be addressed for better developer experience.
