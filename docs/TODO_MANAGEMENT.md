## Progress Tracking System

### 1. Todo List Maintenance

The todo list is maintained in multiple places for different purposes:

- **Claude's Memory**: In-conversation todo tracking
- **TRACK2_PROGRESS.md**: Detailed progress with timestamps
- **IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md**: Overall project status

### 2. Update Process

After completing each task:

1. **Mark task complete in todo list**
   ```bash
   # Use the update script
   ./scripts/update-progress.sh <task-id> "Brief notes about completion"
   ```

2. **Update test coverage** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   go test -tags="nodiscovery" -cover ./...
   ```

3. **Commit with clear message**
   ```
   feat(track2): implement Go client library
   
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implemented connection pooling
   - Test coverage: 85%
   ```

### 3. Daily Progress Format

Start each day by reviewing and updating:

```markdown
### Date: 2024-MM-DD

**Current Task**: [Task name and ID]
**Progress**: [Percentage or description]
**Blockers**: [Any issues]
**Next Task**: [What's planned next]
```

### 4. Weekly Summary Template

At the end of each week:

```markdown
## Week N Summary

**Tasks Completed**: X of Y
**Test Coverage**: XX%
**Key Achievements**:
- Achievement 1
- Achievement 2

**Challenges Faced**:
- Challenge and resolution

**Next Week Focus**:
- Priority tasks
```

## Task Prioritization

### Priority Levels

1. **üî¥ Critical (High)**: Blocks other work or core functionality
2. **üü° Important (Medium)**: Enhances functionality or developer experience
3. **üü¢ Nice-to-have (Low)**: Optimizations or additional features

### Current Priorities

| Task | Priority | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Go client library | üî¥ High | Needed for testing and examples |
| TypeScript client | üî¥ High | Web integration critical |
| Python client | üî¥ High | AI agent integration |
| JWT auth | üü° Medium | Security important but not blocking |
| Redis caching | üü° Medium | Performance optimization |
| Integration tests | üî¥ High | Verify track compatibility |

## Automation Tools

### 1. Progress Update Script
Located at `scripts/update-progress.sh`:
- Automatically updates progress files
- Creates git commits
- Shows remaining todos
- Calculates completion percentage

### 2. Test Coverage Tracker
```bash
# Run tests and save coverage
go test -tags="nodiscovery" -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

### 3. Todo Extraction
```bash
# Find all todos in code
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.go" pkg/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Granularity
- Each task should be completable in 1-2 days
- Break large tasks into subtasks
- Define clear completion criteria

### 2. Documentation
- Update docs immediately after task completion
- Include examples and usage instructions
- Keep README files current

### 3. Testing
- Write tests before marking task complete
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Include integration tests where applicable

### 4. Code Reviews
- Self-review using `git diff`
- Check for TODOs before committing
- Ensure consistent code style

## Integration Points

### Track 1 Dependencies
- Monitor Track 1 progress weekly
- Update integration points as needed
- Test with mock implementations first

### Track 3-4 Preparation
- Design client libraries with Track 3-4 needs in mind
- Document API contracts clearly
- Provide usage examples

## Success Metrics

### Week 3 Goals
- All 3 client libraries functional
- Authentication system complete
- 60% test coverage overall
- Documentation updated

### Week 4 Goals
- Production-ready deployment
- 70% test coverage
- Performance benchmarks complete
- Full integration test suite

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Track 1 delays | Continue with mocks | ‚úÖ Resolved |
| Complex auth requirements | Start simple, iterate | ‚è≥ Planning |
| Performance issues | Profile early | üìã Planned |
| Integration challenges | Clear interfaces | ‚úÖ In place |
