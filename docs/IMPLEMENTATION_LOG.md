2. **Language Decision**: Go for Discovery Core and Interface Layer, Python for AI agents
   - Rationale: Performance for core engine and API layer, flexibility for AI agents
   - Impact: Strong performance foundation with Go, AI flexibility with Python

3. **Sampling Strategy**: Adaptive sampling based on data characteristics
