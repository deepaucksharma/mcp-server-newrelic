## Key Decisions Log

### December 2024

1. **Architecture Decision**: Chose multi-agent architecture over monolithic design
   - Rationale: Better scalability, maintainability, and specialization
   - Impact: More complex coordination but clearer responsibilities

2. **Language Decision**: Go for Discovery Core and Interface Layer, Python for AI agents
   - Rationale: Performance for core engine and API layer, flexibility for AI agents
   - Impact: Strong performance foundation with Go, AI flexibility with Python

3. **Sampling Strategy**: Adaptive sampling based on data characteristics
   - Rationale: Minimize NRDB query costs while maintaining accuracy
   - Impact: More complex implementation but significant cost savings

4. **Interface Layer Architecture**: Unified interface layer serving MCP, REST, CLI, and SSE
   - Rationale: Single point of access for all UDS capabilities with multiple protocols
   - Impact: Consistent experience across AI agents, applications, and developers

5. **Build Tag Isolation**: Using Go build tags to isolate Track 2 from Track 1
   - Rationale: Enable parallel development without dependency conflicts
   - Impact: Clean separation allowing independent testing and development

6. **Framework Choices**: Gorilla Mux over Gin, Cobra for CLI
   - Rationale: Better control and smaller dependencies with Mux, industry standard CLI with Cobra
   - Impact: More explicit routing but better understanding of request flow

## Metrics & KPIs
