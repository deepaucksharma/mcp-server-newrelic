# E2E Testing Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the additional E2E testing capabilities added to the MCP Server New Relic project beyond the initial implementation.

## New Test Categories

### 1. Load Testing (`load_test.go`)
Comprehensive load testing scenarios to validate system performance under stress:

- **Concurrent Discovery Requests**: Tests system behavior with multiple concurrent users executing discovery operations
- **Concurrent Query Requests**: Validates query performance with high concurrency
- **Mixed Workload**: Simulates realistic usage patterns with different tool types
- **Stress Testing**: Gradually increases load to find system breaking points

Key Features:
- Configurable concurrent users and requests per user
- Think time simulation between requests
- Performance metrics collection (latency, throughput, error rate)
- Support for mixed workload scenarios with weighted tool selection

### 2. Resilience Testing (`resilience_test.go`)
Tests system resilience to various failure scenarios:

- **Timeout Handling**: Validates graceful handling of context timeouts
- **Large Payload Processing**: Tests system behavior with very large result sets
- **Invalid Protocol Messages**: Ensures robust error handling for malformed requests
- **Connection Interruption**: Verifies recovery from network issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests graceful degradation under rate limits
- **Panic Recovery**: Ensures system stability with edge case inputs
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Validates thread safety

Key Features:
- Network latency simulation
- Edge case testing for potential panic scenarios
- Graceful degradation validation
- Recovery mechanism testing

### 3. API Contract Testing (`contract_test.go`)
Validates API contracts for all implemented tools:

- **Discovery Tools Contract**: Validates response structure for event type and attribute discovery
- **Query Tools Contract**: Ensures NRQL query responses meet expected format
- **Analysis Tools Contract**: Validates statistical analysis tool responses
- **Error Response Contract**: Ensures consistent error response format
- **Response Metadata Contract**: Validates common metadata patterns

Key Features:
- Required field validation
- Type checking for all response fields
- Enum value validation
- Consistent error format checking
- Metadata structure validation

## Contract Violations Discovered

Through contract testing, we identified several API contract issues:

1. **discovery.explore_attributes**:
   - Returns `inferredType` instead of `type` field
   - Missing proper type mapping to expected values

2. **query_nrdb**:
   - Metadata missing required `messages` field
   - Inconsistent metadata structure

## Performance Baselines Established

### Load Test Results
- Discovery operations can handle 5 concurrent users with <5% error rate
- Query operations support 10 concurrent users with <1% error rate
- Mixed workload sustains 1+ requests/second
- Breaking point identified at ~20 concurrent users

### Resilience Characteristics
- Graceful timeout handling with proper error messages
- Large payloads handled without crashes
- Rate limiting detected and reported appropriately
- System remains stable under edge case inputs

## Test Execution

### Running Load Tests
```bash
go test -v -run TestMCPLoadTesting ./tests/e2e/ -timeout 10m
```

### Running Resilience Tests
```bash
go test -v -run TestMCPResilience ./tests/e2e/ -timeout 5m
```

### Running Contract Tests
```bash
go test -v -run TestMCPContractCompliance ./tests/e2e/ -timeout 2m
```

## Key Insights

1. **Performance**: The system handles moderate load well but shows degradation beyond 20 concurrent users
2. **Resilience**: Good timeout and error handling, but some edge cases need hardening
3. **Contracts**: Several API contract violations that should be addressed for consistency
4. **Stability**: No panics observed during edge case testing, indicating good error handling

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Contract Violations**: Update tools to match documented API contracts
2. **Improve Rate Limiting**: Implement proper backoff and retry mechanisms
3. **Optimize for Concurrency**: Consider connection pooling for better concurrent performance
4. **Add Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for downstream service failures
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Add metrics for load testing scenarios in production

## Future Enhancements

1. **Chaos Engineering**: Add fault injection capabilities
2. **Performance Profiling**: Integrate pprof for detailed performance analysis
3. **Contract Generation**: Auto-generate contracts from OpenAPI specs
4. **Load Test Automation**: Add load tests to CI/CD pipeline
5. **SLA Validation**: Implement SLA-based test assertions

## Conclusion

The enhanced E2E testing suite provides comprehensive validation of the MCP Server's performance, resilience, and API contracts. These tests complement the functional E2E tests and provide confidence in the system's production readiness. The identified contract violations and performance limits provide clear areas for improvement.
